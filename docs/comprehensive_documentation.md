## Project Overview

The Online Learning System is a comprehensive platform designed to facilitate online education through a structured system of courses, lessons, assignments, and assessments. The platform supports three distinct user roles - students, instructors, and employees - each with specific permissions and capabilities.

## System Architecture

The application follows a Model-View-Template (MVT) architecture pattern using Django framework:

### Apps Structure
1. **accounts** - User authentication and management
2. **courses** - Course, category, tag, enrollment, and review management
3. **lessons** - Lesson content delivery
4. **assignments** - Assignment creation and submission system

### Key Components
- Custom user model with role-based authentication
- RESTful URL design
- Responsive UI with Tailwind CSS
- Media file handling
- Comprehensive testing suite

## User Roles and Permissions
