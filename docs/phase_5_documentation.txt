Documentation for Phase 5: Develop Dashboards for Student, Instructor, and Employee Roles

Overview
--------
This phase focuses on creating comprehensive dashboards for each user role in the Online Learning System. The dashboards provide role-specific insights, summaries, and quick access to relevant features. Each dashboard is designed to be user-friendly, responsive, and informative, helping users quickly understand their current status and navigate to important functions.

Objectives
----------
- Create a Student Dashboard showing enrolled courses, lesson progress, and recent activity
- Create an Instructor Dashboard displaying course statistics, student enrollments, and recent courses
- Create an Employee Dashboard with system-wide statistics and management shortcuts
- Implement role-based access control to ensure dashboard privacy
- Include charts or summaries where feasible
- Ensure all dashboards are user-friendly and responsive

These objectives are crucial for providing an intuitive user experience where each role can quickly access the information and tools most relevant to them.

Implementation Approach
-----------------------
- Enhanced the accounts app with dedicated dashboard views for each role:
  - Student dashboard with enrollment statistics and progress tracking
  - Instructor dashboard with course and enrollment statistics
  - Employee dashboard with system-wide metrics and management links
- Created visually appealing templates for each dashboard using Tailwind CSS
- Implemented role-based access control to ensure users can only access their respective dashboards
- Added statistical summaries and visual indicators for quick understanding
- Included navigation links to related features and management tools
- Designed responsive layouts that work well on both desktop and mobile devices

Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------
- Student: Can view their dashboard with enrolled courses and progress
- Instructor: Can view their dashboard with course statistics and management tools
- Employee: Can view their dashboard with system statistics and management shortcuts
- Developer: Responsible for implementing the views, templates, and access controls

Expected Deliverables or Outcomes
---------------------------------
- Fully functional dashboards for all three user roles
- Role-based access control ensuring dashboard privacy
- Responsive UI templates with dark theme using Tailwind CSS
- Statistical summaries and visual indicators
- Quick access to relevant features and management tools
- Updated project documentation

Caveats & Considerations
------------------------
- The implementation uses Django's built-in authentication and permission system
- Dashboards are designed to be lightweight and load quickly
- Statistics are calculated dynamically based on current data
- The employee dashboard includes links to Django admin for advanced management
- All dashboards are responsive and work well on different screen sizes
- The implementation maintains data integrity through proper access controls
