Documentation for Phase 4: Enrollment and Course Progress Tracking

Overview
--------
This phase implements the core functionality for student enrollment in courses and progress tracking. It introduces models to manage the relationship between students and courses, track lesson completion, and provide dashboards for both students and employees to view enrollment information. The implementation enables students to browse courses, enroll in them, and track their progress through lessons.

Objectives
----------
- Build Enrollment model connecting students and courses
- Enable browsing/filtering courses by category, tag, or instructor
- Allow students to enroll in courses
- Implement lesson completion tracking per enrollment
- Create student dashboard to show enrolled courses and progress
- Provide employee interface to view and manage all enrollments
- Implement progress tracking with visual indicators

These objectives are crucial for creating an engaging learning experience where students can track their progress and employees can monitor enrollment activity.

Implementation Approach
-----------------------
- Extended the courses app with new models:
  - Enrollment: Links students to courses with enrollment date and completion status
  - LessonCompletion: Tracks individual lesson completion for each enrollment
- Updated the Course model with helper methods for lesson counting
- Created views for all enrollment-related functionality:
  - Course browsing with filtering by category, tag, and instructor
  - Student enrollment in courses
  - Student dashboard showing enrolled courses with progress bars
  - Course lessons view showing completion status
  - Employee enrollment management interface
- Developed templates for all views using Tailwind CSS with dark theme
- Added navigation links to the base template for easy access to new features
- Implemented progress calculation methods in the Enrollment model
- Created a management command to populate sample enrollments for testing
- Added completion functionality for lessons with automatic course completion detection

Roles and Responsibilities
--------------------------
- Student: Can browse courses, enroll in courses, view their dashboard, and mark lessons as complete
- Instructor: Can view enrollments in their courses through the admin interface
- Employee: Can view and manage all enrollments through both admin and public views
- Developer: Responsible for implementing the models, views, and templates; maintaining role-based access controls

Expected Deliverables or Outcomes
---------------------------------
- Fully functional enrollment system with progress tracking
- Course browsing with comprehensive filtering options
- Student dashboard with visual progress indicators
- Employee enrollment management interface
- Lesson completion tracking with automatic course completion
- Responsive UI templates with dark theme using Tailwind CSS
- Sample data for enrollments
- Updated project documentation and requirements

Caveats & Considerations
------------------------
- The implementation uses Django's built-in authentication and permission system
- Progress tracking is calculated dynamically based on completed lessons
- Course completion is automatically detected when all lessons are completed
- The student dashboard provides a visual overview of all enrolled courses
- Employees have comprehensive access to enrollment data through both admin and public views
- Filtering options for course browsing include category, tag, and instructor
- The implementation maintains data integrity through model relationships and constraints
